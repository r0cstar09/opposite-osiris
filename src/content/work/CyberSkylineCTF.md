## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Although NCL challenges are simulated, many tasks align with real adversary behaviors.

| NCL Category              | ATT&CK Technique(s)                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Password Cracking         | Credential Access (T1110)                                     |
| OSINT                     | Reconnaissance (T1591, T1592, T1596)                         |
| Log Analysis              | Defense Evasion & Discovery (T1070, T1087, T1083)            |
| Forensics                 | Collection (T1005), Artifact Analysis                         |
| Web Exploitation          | Initial Access (T1190), Exploitation for Privilege Escalation |
| Network Traffic Analysis  | Command & Control (T1071), Exfiltration (T1041)               |

## Real-World Applications

**Threat Intelligence:**  
- Extracting indicators from incomplete datasets mirrors TI triage workflows.  
- Mapping task behaviors to ATT&CK demonstrates adversary-centric analysis.

**Incident Response:**  
- Log analysis → event timeline reconstruction  
- Password cracking → credential compromise validation  
- Network traffic analysis → C2 pattern identification  

**Security Operations:**  
- Recon & scanning → baseline assessment and misconfiguration identification  
- OSINT → external attack surface profiling  
- Web exploitation → common web attack pattern recognition

## Leadership & Strategy

As Team Captain, I implemented a workflow centered on:

- **Rapid early triage:** Assigning modules based on team strengths  
- **Two-phase strategy:** Quick wins → deep-dive tasks  
- **Cross-verification:** Ensuring accuracy before answer submission  
- **Time management:** 15–20 minute review cycles per module  

These leadership skills translate directly to security operations and incident response environments where multi-disciplinary coordination is essential.

## Lessons Learned

- The importance of structured triage when multiple categories are active simultaneously  
- The advantage of clean note-taking and process documentation under time pressure  
- The value of cross-checking assumptions before committing answers  
- The impact of assigning tasks based on strengths when leading a technical team
