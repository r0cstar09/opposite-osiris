## Overview

The **Evidence Hasher** is a lightweight, platform-agnostic Python utility designed to
produce cryptographically verifiable SHA-256 hashes for every file in a target directory.
It outputs a **CSV manifest** containing:

- File name  
- File extension  
- SHA-256 hash  
- Created timestamp  
- Modified timestamp  

The tool is used to maintain proper **chain of custody**, ensure **evidence immutability**, and
support compliance with forensic and legal documentation standards.

This tool was built to support real-world evidence preservation for cybersecurity and legal workflows, while also serving as a publicly demonstrable example of secure automation practices.

## Key Features

### **1. Full-Directory Hashing**
Automatically processes **all files** in the directory, regardless of extension.

### **2. Forensic-Safe Workflow**
No file modification; the tool opens files in read-only binary mode.

### **3. SHA-256 Integrity Guarantees**
Industry-standard hashing algorithm suitable for digital forensics, IR reports, legal submissions, and audit workflows.

### **4. Timestamp Preservation**
Captures both:
- OS-level creation time  
- Last-modified time  

### **5. Excel-Compatible Manifest Output**
Produces `manifest.csv`, which can be validated, archived, or attached to casework.

## Code Implementation (Public Version)

```python
import os
import hashlib
import datetime
from pathlib import Path

output_file = "manifest.csv"
folder = Path(".")

files = [file for file in folder.iterdir() if file.is_file()]

with open(output_file, "w") as f:
    f.write("Filename,Extension,SHA256,Created,Modified\n")
    for file in files:
        with open(file, "rb") as data:
            hash_val = hashlib.sha256(data.read()).hexdigest()

        stat = file.stat()
        created = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(stat.st_ctime).isoformat()
        modified = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(stat.st_mtime).isoformat()

        f.write(f"{file.name},{file.suffix},{hash_val},{created},{modified}\n")

print(f"Done. Manifest saved to {output_file}")
